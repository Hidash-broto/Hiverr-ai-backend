    Task context (JSON): ${JSON.stringify(data)}

    Goal: send ONE short opening line that feels personal and starts a useful chat about this specific task/event.

    Do:
    - Refer to the task/event by name (or a natural paraphrase).
    - Gently acknowledge the likely vibe (busy, excited, stressed) using clues like due date, priority, status, notes.
    - Ask exactly ONE friendly, concrete question that helps progress: e.g., why it's important, any blockers, when to schedule it, reminder preference, need to break it into steps, or reschedule.
    - If due soon or overdue, surface that kindly and offer help; if completed, celebrate and ask for quick wrap‑up.
    - Keep it casual: 1–2 short sentences max, contractions ok, 0–1 emoji, tiny natural imperfection allowed.
    - If a name exists (assignee/owner/user), greet them briefly by first name.

    Don't:
    - Be long, list things, or ask multiple questions.
    - Say "As an AI" or mention metadata/JSON.

    Output only the message text.`
